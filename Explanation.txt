### Explanation:

1. CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):  
   - CI/CD automates the process of testing and delivering code.  
   - CI (Continuous Integration): Every time you update code, it is automatically tested to ensure it works.  
   - CD (Continuous Deployment): After testing, the code is automatically deployed (sent to users or systems).  
   - Use: Saves time, reduces errors, and ensures faster delivery of updates.

2. GitHub CI:  
   - GitHub CI is a tool in GitHub that helps automate testing and deploying code.  
   - Use: It runs tests on your code automatically whenever you push updates to your GitHub repository.

3. Docker:  
   - Docker creates containers that package your application and all its dependencies so it runs the same anywhere.  
   - Use: Ensures your app works the same on any computer, server, or cloud.

4. Docker Hub:  
   - Docker Hub is like a storage site for Docker images (pre-packaged apps).  
   - Use: You upload your app’s container (Docker image) to Docker Hub so others or systems can download and run it.

5. Kubernetes:  
   - Kubernetes is a system to manage and scale Docker containers.  
   - Use: It ensures your app runs smoothly, handles multiple users, and restarts your app if something goes wrong.

6. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):  
   - AKS is Kubernetes provided by Microsoft Azure (a cloud platform).  
   - Use: It lets you use Kubernetes on Azure to manage and run your Docker containers in the cloud.


### Summary:  
1. CI/CD: Tests and deploys your code automatically.  
2. GitHub CI: Runs automated tests and processes using GitHub.  
3. Docker: Packages your app and its dependencies to run anywhere.  
4. Docker Hub: Stores and shares Docker containers.  
5. Kubernetes: Manages and scales Docker containers.  
6. Azure Kubernetes (AKS): Runs Kubernetes on Microsoft’s Azure cloud.
